reate and Configure Cognito:

Create Pool, name it my-users-pool.
Create App client, name it my-users-pool-clients.
Write down the pool name, pool Id, client name and app clients id.

Notes 
  * Enable MFA if needed.
  * You can use the trigger for more security
  * For development we will let user register themselves, on production you might restrict registration by the administrators only (on Policies -> check "Only allow administrators to create users").
  * If MFA enabled, a Role to allow Amazon Cognito to send SMS messages must be created.

Open Cognito from the Security, Identity, & Compliance group in AWS console
